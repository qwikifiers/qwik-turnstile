## Be Kind - Code of Conduct

Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to help us keep this project open and inclusive.

<br/>

## Found a bug? Want a feature? - Submit an Issue

[Choose an issue template](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-turnstile/issues/new/choose) to file a bug report / feature request.

<br/>

## Ready to contribute a Pull Request (PR)?

<br/>

### ‚ñ∂ 1. First - [Search this repo for existing PRs](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-turnstile/pulls) !

Try to find an open or closed PR that relates to the change you want to introduce.

<br/>

### ‚ñ∂ 2. **Before you start coding - [find](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-turnstile/issues) / [create an issue](https://github.com/qwikifiers/qwik-turnstile/issues/new/choose)**

**Make sure there's an issue** describing the problem you're fixing, or documents the design for the feature you'd like to add.
Discussing the design up front helps to ensure that we're ready to accept your work.

**Don't waste your time working on code before you got a üëç in an issue comment.**

<br/>

### ‚ñ∂ 3. Fork the this repo and create a branch.

- Hit that "Fork" button above (in this repo's github page).

- Create a new branch locally in your fork's repo

```shell
git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
```

<br/>

### ‚ñ∂ 4. Build the library

- From the root of the project run `pnpm install`.

- Then run `pnpm build`.

- Visit the URL printed in the console and you'll have a page opened with the suite of widgets.

### ‚ñ∂ 5. Add a "changeset"

For your convenience, we prepared a video tutorial that covers the process of adding a changeset:

[üìΩ TUTORIAL: Adding a changeset](https://go.screenpal.com/watch/cZivIcVPJQV)

**5.1.** Run the following command to create a changeset:

```shell
pnpm change
```

**5.2.** Choose the packages that should be included in the changeset

**5.3** Choose the specific type of change

(hit `Enter` if you need to skip to the next option)

- `major` for breaking changes
- `minor` for new features
- `patch` for bug fixes

**5.4.** Prefix your change title with one of these:

- `FEAT:` or `feat:` for features
- `FIX:` or `fix:` for bug fixes
- `DOCS` or `docs:` for documentation

**5.5.** Modify the created MD file

After the `change` command runs, a new MD file will be created under the `.changeset` folder.

Please modify this file to include a descriptive message of the changes you made.

You can even add code examples if you need do, to describe a new feature for example. (pun intended üòâ)

The prefix and this elaborated description will be used to create the changelog files and release notes, so please give them love. üíóüòä

#### ‚ùì "What if my PR is not a significant change?"

If you made small changes like fixing typos, CI config, prettier, etc, you can run `pnpm change add --empty` to generate an empty changeset file to document
your changes.

---

### ‚ñ∂ 6. Push your branch to GitHub:

```shell
git push origin my-fix-branch
```

### ‚ñ∂ 7. Create a PR

In GitHub, create a pull request for `qwikifiers/qwik-turnstile:main`.

Make sure you check the following checkbox "Allow edits from maintainers" -

If you need to update your PR for some reason -

- Make the required updates.

- Re-run the tests to ensure tests are still passing `pnpm run test`

- Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

  ```shell
  git rebase main -i
  git push -f
  ```

<br/>

### ‚ñ∂ 8. After your PR is merged - delete your branches

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

  ```shell
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
  ```

- Check out the `main` branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout main -f
  ```

- Delete the local branch:

  ```shell
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  ```

- Update your `main` with the latest upstream version:

  ```shell
  git pull --ff upstream main
  ```

### ‚ñ∂ 9. That's it! Thank you for your contribution! üôèüíì
